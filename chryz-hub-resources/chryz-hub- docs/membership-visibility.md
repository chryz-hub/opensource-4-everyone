# Membership Visibilty Tutorial

This would be a short tutorial on how to make a your membership to a community visible or maybe hidden for a particular reason. I know we would all want
our membership to be visible and that's why this was created.

### Initially

After joining a community as a member, Github automatically makes it hidden(private), making only the members of the same
community to see your membership, not the public at large. So, you need to enable this yourself, for people to discover you!

This is mine, it is visible to everyone, why?
Because I enabled it myself!

### So, let's make yours🚀

<b> 1. Click the people tab</b>

You have to be on the community page, where you are a member and click the `people` tab.

<b> 2. Search and find out your name</b>

Then you would find a list of the community members, then search out and find your name and we can all see from the picture below, that there is a difference,
only an account is made public and the others private. So you would have to click the `private` button to toggle it `public`

</b> 3. Changing the visiblity</b>

After clicking it, something like this, as shown in the image below would show up. Then you would have to pick any one of your choice, either
public or private.

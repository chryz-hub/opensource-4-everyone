Contributing
============
If you want to contribute to a project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.

### How to make a clean pull request

Look for a project's contribution instructions. If you find any, then let's follow these steps.

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `develop` if it exists, else from `master`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- If the project has tests run them!
- Write or adapt tests as needed.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Squash your commits into a single commit with the community [git tips](https://github.com/chryz-hub/opensource-4-everyone/blob/master/chryz-hub-resources/git.md). Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `develop` branch if there is one, else go for `master`!
- â€¦
- If the maintainer requests further changes just push them to your branch. The PR will be updated automatically.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es).

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.

 ... and many more!

 ## Simple Guide to Making a PR or Contribution.
- ### Fork/ Edit
It is advisable to first fork the repo you want to contribute to and then move to check the available repositories in your GiHub account, there you would find the forked repo. The word 'fork' been stated here, gives you a version of that exact repository or instead of forking better still You can click on the edit(pencil) button, and this automatically forks the repo to your version. Make sure you are in the right repository before forking or editing it, can you see the name of the repo, check it!

- ### Start Making contribution/ changes
There is a difference in the naming of the repo, I already got my personal version of the repo because I forked it or edited it. So, you can start making the changes and adding anything you feel like and after this, commit the changes and put a precise/ short commit message. This is where the contribution starts, add the features intended!

- ### Create Pull Request
Then, click the pull request tab and make new pull request
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/chryz-hub/opensource-4-everyone/blob/master/pull-request-tutorial-pics/create-PR.png" />
After that, GitHub would make a comparism between your own verison(forked) of the repo and the real repository to check if there was a change and if the change is mergeable. If it is not mergeable, you can still make the pull request and resolve it(reoslve conflicts), GitHub would point out the issue which makes it easier. Once it is mergable, you can click create your pull request
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/chryz-hub/opensource-4-everyone/blob/master/pull-request-tutorial-pics/pr%20in%20progress.png" />
Now, you need to **open the pull request**, this entails
 - Typing down a short/ precise commit message
 - Our community has a pull request template which makes it easier to fill in important and apprioprate details concerning the pull request. I only typed down the work of the PR, because I saw the rest as unimportant pertaining to what PR I was making!
